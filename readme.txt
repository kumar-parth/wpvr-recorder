WP Voice Recorder can help us to record the posts and play them in the front end. 

== Description ==

WP Voice Recorder can help us to record the posts and play them in the front end. It allows us to save the recorded audios into a dropbox account instead of saving it to the server files as it eats up memory.
It adds a settings page to "Dashboard"->"Settings"->"WP Voice Recorder Settings" where you can add your Dropbox account access token.
If the field "Enter the API token" was not set or invalid, it will not save the recorded files into your dropbox account.

= Usage =

1. Download and extract `WP Voice Recorder.zip` to `wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. "Dashboard"->"Settings"->"WP Voice Recorder Settings" to set your Dropbox Access Token.
4. It will create a recorder in each posts editor and there you can record your voice and publish or update your posts.

== Installation ==

1. Download and extract `WP Voice Recorder.zip` to `wp-content/plugins/`
